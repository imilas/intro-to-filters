1. can k be only whole values? how many bins can we have when using DFT? is this affected by length of signal? What about sampling rate?
2. Does Demoivre's theorem only apply to integer powers?
3. instantanious phase of a sinusoid can change. What effect does this have on the frequency? https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/mdft/Sinusoids.html
